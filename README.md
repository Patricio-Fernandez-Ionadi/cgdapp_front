# About this project

This is an independant project just for fun and learn about web development. I
have tried to do this app last year, but i got frustrated by my knowledgeless
about back-end and data-base. This year i restarted it in a new repository
trying to apply new knowledges such as nodejs for back-end and mongoDB for data
storage. Hope i finish it this time... wishme luck!

You can find the past project on
[my profile](https://github.com/Patricio-Fernandez-Ionadi) with the name
'ReactApp-ControlGastos'.
[Repository](https://github.com/Patricio-Fernandez-Ionadi/ReactApp-ControlGastos).

The back-end of this app is goint to be [here](asd) `not uploaded yet`

**The back-end repository is not uploaded yet because i have to see how to
protect some delicate information**
